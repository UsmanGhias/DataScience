# DataScience
 My Data Science GitHub repository contains various data science projects and scripts, including data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning models. The repository showcases my skills in Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and more. Additionally, I have also included a course on the basics of data science to help beginners get started with the field.
